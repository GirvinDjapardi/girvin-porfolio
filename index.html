                Driven by our motivation to help people who have difficulty expressing themselves verbally due to unique conditions (for example, Aphasia), my team and I built SynapseAI — a device that reads your thoughts using EEG and outputs an AI-generated video based on it. Here's how we did it:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ We read brainwaves from the Muse® by Interaxon Inc. EEG headset</li>
                <li>🧮 Used Digital Signal Processing to extract features from the complex time series data and create a feature vector</li>
                <li>🏹 Trained a Convolutional Neural Network to convert the EEG features into vector embeddings</li>
                <li>📊 Stored these vectors in a vector database using Chroma Cloud</li>
                <li>💭 Categorized the thoughts into 5 main categories based on emotions they elicit and used K-Nearest Neighbors to find the thought category a sample matched closest to</li>
                <li>🩻 Used LangChain Agents to expand upon the thought and incorporate real-time stress data from the Garmin Watch using Terra API to create a comprehensive prompt</li>
                <li>🎥 Finally, used the prompt for the Luma AI API to generate high quality AI videos of your thoughts!</li>

                Driven by a personally felt pain point of poor faculty to student ratio that exists in many educational institutions, we built EduGap, an AI-driven Chrome Extension for Google Classroom. Our platform allows students to get access to custom chat bots, which outputs accurate and real-time answers based on resources (from various file types to assignments) uploaded by teachers.
                <br><br>
                On top of this, using machine learning algorithms and vector embedding for text, we created an algorithm that analyzes what topics students are most confused about and then provide teachers real-time feedback and recommendations. This allows teachers to identity recurring knowledge gaps that exists within their classes, increasing the quality of their teaching plans and student-teacher interactions.
                <br><br>
                Our vision with EduGap is to un-antagonize the use of AI in our classrooms, and instead bridge the gap that exists between faculty in students in oftentimes strained educational systems.

            <p>
                In this project, my team and I were given the task to engineer a robot that was capable of navigating across a black-against-white terrain trek filled with curves and turns.
                <br><br>
                With LDRs and LEDs as the robot's eyes, we were able to instruct the robot (with Arduino) to execute real-time path adjustment. In other words, when both LDR detects low light levels (as the color of our terrain is black), the robot will continue on a straight path.
                <br><br>
                However, if, for example, the left LDR detects high light levels (as it approaches a curve that demands a right turn), the robot will then halt movement in its right wheels, allowing the robot to slowly turn right until both LDR detects high light levels, in which it will continue traversing forward.
                <br><br>
                As the Mechanical Engineer of my team, I was in charge of building the robots body and assembling its chassis and wheels. A key highlight was when I successfully optimized the positioning of the its 'eyes' and wheels to increase the turning success rate of our robot.
